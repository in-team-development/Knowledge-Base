# [in-Team Knowledge Base](https://in-team-development.github.io/Knowledge-Base/)
This repository contains useful links, articles and sources.

Short-lived links, like framework's new version release, should go on slack channel.
Here we will keep long-term-knowledge.

Links are divided per department:

* [Frontend](/links/links-frontend.md)
* [Backend](links/links-backend.md)
* [Data Science](links/links-data.md)
